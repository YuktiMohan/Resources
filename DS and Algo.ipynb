    "Data structures are the raw materials and algorithm is the process. When an algorithm is applied on data structures we get our desired output. These two topics are a must have for all branches because these provide you with a foundation for all the other fields relating to electronics, communication and majorly Computer science.\n",

    "3. Coursera: This is a specialization and it consists of 6 courses. On coursera, more often than not, you can audit a course which means that you will get access to all the study material but you will not be able to submit your assignments for grading and hence you wonâ€™t be getting a certification on completion of the course. If you wish to get the certificate you can always buy the course. But I would suggest that you must not buy all the courses and use the study material to enhance your knowledge on subjects like graphic designing where the value of your work and projects is more than the certification of completion of the course.\n",
